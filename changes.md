## To Do
- add some hard-coded content in route to show passing in data
- add in hard-coded array in route, with `@foreach` in template
- output the list of articles with a var_dump in controller to keep Blade separate?
- Add Forms material
- Add login form material
- Update routes to use array instead of "@" for controller/method
- MySQL examples more generic (with placeholders `table name`, `field name`, TYPE)
