## To Do

- add MySQL `DESCRIBE` as a utility function (students find this useful)
- Add search form to Forms
- Add database seeding to Eloquent ORM
- Update routes to use array instead of "@" for controller/method
- MySQL examples more generic (with placeholders `table name`, `field name`, TYPE)
- more templates and routes before controller so process is more practiced
- Add notes to deployment
    * [ ] Using scp to copy files to server
    * [ ] Doing a DB dump
    * [ ] Doing a DB un-dump
- Auth should include middleware to check user owns the article
- Use scopes to handle different auth levels
    * [ ] Update notes
    * [ ] Update challenges
- Mention documenting APIs
- Auth should link up with Week 7
    * [ ] Introduce roles in week 7
    * [ ] Link articles to users in week 7
- More detail in HTTP/API chapters
- API design needn't reflect database structure
- Add TDD to tags Controller logic
