Tags and articles have a more complex relationship than comments and articles. An article can have any number of tags, but a tag can also belong to any number of articles. This is a many-to-many relationship. These relationships are symmetrical: neither side \textit{belongs} to to the other side.
\\

We can't reference the article or tag ID from the other table in this case, as that way we could only reference a single item. In this case we need a \textbf{pivot table}. The pivot table \textit{just} stores the relationship between an article and a tag using an \texttt{article\_id} and a \texttt{tag\_id} column:

It is possible to store additional information about the relationship on a pivot table, which Eloquent makes available on the model's \texttt{pivot} property, but in our case this won't be necessary.


\begin{infobox}{Termlists}
    It's quite common with databases to have tables which effectively just store a list of strings with an associated ID: e.g. countries, cities, genders, etc. These are sometimes referred to as \textbf{termlists} (because it's a list of terms):

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabu} {| c | l |}
             \hline
             \texttt{id}   & \texttt{country} \\
             \hline
             1             & Algeria          \\
             2             & Burkina Faso     \\
             3             & Cambodia         \\
             \textellipsis & \textellipsis    \\
             \hline
        \end{tabu}
        \quad
        \begin{tabu} {| c | l |}
             \hline
             \texttt{id}   & \texttt{gender} \\
             \hline
             1             & Female          \\
             2             & Male            \\
             3             & Non-Binary      \\
             \textellipsis & \textellipsis   \\
             \hline
        \end{tabu}
    \end{center}

    It's a good idea to use the same column name for the string column for all your termlists. For example rather than having a \texttt{country} column in the \texttt{countries} table and a \texttt{gender} column in the \texttt{genders} table, you should always call the column something like \texttt{name}:

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabu} {| c | l |}
             \hline
             \texttt{id}   & \texttt{name} \\
             \hline
             1             & Algeria       \\
             2             & Burkina Faso  \\
             3             & Cambodia      \\
             \textellipsis & \textellipsis \\
             \hline
        \end{tabu}
        \quad
        \begin{tabu} {| c | l |}
             \hline
             \texttt{id}   & \texttt{name} \\
             \hline
             1             & Female        \\
             2             & Male          \\
             3             & Non-Binary    \\
             \textellipsis & \textellipsis \\
             \hline
        \end{tabu}
    \end{center}

    You normally need to do similar sorts of things to all your termlists: e.g. list them, reorganise them, add items, remove items, etc. By giving them all the same structure you can reuse the same bits of code for all of them.
    \\

    Generally it's not very useful to store timestamps on termlist tables.
\end{infobox}



\section{Database Migration}

We'll need a \texttt{Tag} model shortly, so let's create that at the same time as the database migration using \texttt{artisan}:

\begin{minted}{bash}
    artisan make:model Tag -m
\end{minted}

The database migration for the tags is going to be more complicated than for comments as we'll need to create \textit{two} tables: a termlist table for tags and the pivot table. We can create more than one table in a single migration, just by calling \texttt{Schema::create()} twice:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/01-migration-up}

Notice that we've called the pivot table \texttt{article\_tag}. That's because Eloquent can automatically find pivot tables if they're named using the singular version of the two tables being joined together, in alphabetical order, with an underscore between them. You can call it whatever you like, but you'd need to let Laravel know if you chose something else.
\\

We're not done yet. If we create two tables we need to make sure we update the \texttt{down()} method so that both tables are removed if we rollback the migration. It's important that we remove the tables in the opposite order from how they were created: if we try and drop the \texttt{tags} table before the pivot table, the foreign key constraints in the pivot table would all fail (as there would be no valid \texttt{tag\_id}s to point to):

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/02-migration-down}

As a general rule, if you're creating multiple tables, you should always drop them in reverse order.


\section{Eloquent Models}

First, we need to tell the \texttt{Tag} model not to worry about setting the timestamp columns, otherwise we'll get a MySQL error when we try to add a tag. We do this by setting the \texttt{public} property \texttt{timestamps} to \texttt{false}:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/03-timestamps}

Next we should let Eloquent know about the relationship between articles and tags. In the \texttt{Tag} model add an \texttt{articles} method and use the \texttt{belongsToMany()} relationship method:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/04-tag-relationship}

We'll also need to tell the \texttt{Article} model about tags. Again we'll use a plural name for the method. And many-to-many relationships are symmetrical, so we use the \textit{same} relationship method:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/05-article-relationship}

The API we're creating takes an array of tag strings (e.g. \texttt{["Wombats", "Fish", "Spoons"]}) as part of the \texttt{POST}/\texttt{PUT} request when creating/updating an article. We'll need to make sure that we don't create the same tag more than once. Let's add a \texttt{static} method to the \texttt{Tag} class so that we can pass it an array of strings and it will return a collection of \texttt{Tag} objects: if the tag already exists it will find it in the database and if the tag doesn't exist it will create it for us. We'll call the method \texttt{fromStrings}:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/06-Tag-fromStrings}

Because we're using \texttt{create()}, which uses mass assignment, we'll also need to add a \texttt{\$fillable} property to the \texttt{Tag} model:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/07-Tag-fillable}

Now, let's use \texttt{artisan tinker} to see if this works:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/08-tinker}



\section{Controller Logic}

We won't need to add any new routes for tags because they get added as part of the article \texttt{POST}/\texttt{PUT} request. But we will need to update the \texttt{store} and \texttt{update} methods in the \texttt{Articles} controller.
\\

First we'll need to let the \texttt{Articles} controller know where to find the \texttt{Tag} class:

\begin{minted}{php}
    use App\Tag;
\end{minted}

Then we'll need to update the methods. First, we'll change the \texttt{\$request->all()} call into a \texttt{\$request->only()} call: this isn't strictly necessary (as the \texttt{\$fillable} property will ignore \texttt{tags} unless we add it), but it makes it clear that we don't want the tags added just yet. Then we'll use the \texttt{Tag::fromStrings()} method we created earlier to get back a collection of tags that we want to set on the article. We then use the \texttt{sync()} method, which takes an array of \texttt{id}s, to automatically sort out all of the pivot table entries for us:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/09-Articles-tags}

You'll notice we use the same logic for tags in both methods. It would be good to get rid of the repetition. We can add a method to our \texttt{Article} model:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/10-Article-setTags}

And then update the \texttt{Articles} controller:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/11-Articles-tags-redux}


\section{Validation}

We'll need to add validation rules for tags to \texttt{ArticleRequest}. We'll use the \texttt{array} validation type for the \texttt{tags} field. We can also use the \texttt{.*} notation to add validation for the items inside the \texttt{tags} array. In this case we want them to be strings with a maximum length of 30 (we used a \texttt{VARCHAR(30)} for tags):

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/12-validation}


\section{Resource}

Finally, let's update our article resources to include tags as an array. In \texttt{ArticleResource} and \texttt{ArticleListResource}:

\phpinputminted{02/figures/02/13-resource}
