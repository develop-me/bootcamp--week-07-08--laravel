When we're developing server-side code we need to run it somewhere. Obviously we'll want to run it on our own computer, but every computer has a slightly different setup. For example, different versions of macOS have different versions of PHP and Windows doesn't have built-in PHP support.

Ideally we want to develop on something that's as close to the production server as possible. Otherwise there might be bugs in our code that are ``environment'' specific. Setting up our local machines to match the server might not be possible: the specific versions may not be available for your particular setup.

Vagrant allows us to run a ``virtual machine'' on our computer.
