\section{Controllers}

\textbf{Controller} is another term that comes up a lot in software development. A controller's job is to bring together all the other bits of code that make up an app: to \textit{control} what happens. In Laravel, controllers are called by the router: they take the request, do whatever it is that needs doing, and then return a response.

Run the following inside your Vagrant box to create an Articles controller:

\begin{minted}{bash}
    artisan make:controller Articles
\end{minted}

This will create a file (\texttt{app/Http/Controllers/Articles.php}), which contains the boilerplate for a controller.

% output the list of articles with a var_dump to keep Blade separate?
