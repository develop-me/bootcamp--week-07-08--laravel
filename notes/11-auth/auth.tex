\section{Sessions}

It can be useful to keep track of a user on a website. For example, if they login to the website, we want to keep track of them between pages.
\\

We can use a ``cookie'' to store a simple bit of text on the user's computer. This is sent back to the server every time that a request is made. The server can then use this to work out who the user is.

\section{The Auth Package}

First add the UI package to generate the forms for us:

\begin{minted}{php}
    composer require laravel/ui --dev
\end{minted}

Then add the bootstrap Auth UI:

\begin{minted}{php}
    artisan ui bootstrap --auth
\end{minted}

You'll need to update all the views in \texttt{resources/views/auth} to use \texttt{@extends('app')} (instead of \texttt{layouts.app}). You can then remove the \texttt{resources/views/layouts} directory.
\\

We don't want to allow user registration, so we'll turn this off in \texttt{routes/web.php}:

\begin{minted}{php}
    Auth::routes(['register' => false]);
\end{minted}
