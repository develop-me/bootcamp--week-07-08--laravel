# Day 3:

- Explain why singular name used
- Use tinker to create a new model
- Look at `id` after save
- Explain Eloquent models a bit
- Make a change and look at `updated_at` property
- Show `Article::all()` and `Article::find()`
- Quick `Article::where()` demo: `Article::where('title', 'Blah')->orderBy('title')->get()`
- Comparisons `Article::where('updated_at', '>', '2020-03-01')->orderBy('created_at')->get()`

`artisan tinker` command and create a new article:
```bash
$article = new Article();
$article->title = "My amazing blog post";
$article->article = "Today I went shopping. I bought some spoons."; $article->save();
```

### Route Model Binding
