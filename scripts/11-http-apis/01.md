# Day 1: Morning

## HTTP
- Internet vs. web
    - Internet started as a military research project, connecting together computers
    - Web was built on top of internet, linking between research papers
- HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Sending text on port 80
- `telnet info.cern.ch 80`
- Request:

    ```http
    GET /hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: info.cern.ch
    ```

### Requests
- Visit a site in Firefox
- Method
- Resource
- HTTP version
- Host header
- Other headers

#### Methods
- OPTIONS, `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `TRACE`, `CONNECT`
- Browsers stick to `GET` and `POST`

### Responses
- HTTP version
- Status code
- Human readable status
- Headers
- Line break
- Content
- Status codes
    - 2xx: success - 201 Created, 204 No content
    - 3xx: redirects
    - 4xx: client error - 404 Not found
    - 5xx: server error

## APIs
- Application Programming Interface: computers talking to each other
    - Mobile apps
    - Other web sites
    - Smart TVs
    - Toasters
    - Alexa
- Demonstrate Twilio (see `twilio.sh`)
- Has to be well defined
- Generally just return raw data

### RESTful
- An API architecture
- Use HTTP as much as possible: methods, headers, status codes
- Use URLs for different resources
- Use JSON for data

#### JSON
- "JavaScript Object Notation"
- Show an example of JSON (`examples/example.json`)
- *Not* JavaScript: for storing/sending data - readable by any language


#### Methods
- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

#### Status Codes
- `201`: created
- `422`: validation error

#### Resources/End-Points

- Different end-point for different resources
- Show example routes for articles
- Show example for comments on articles

### API Driven Architecture
- All key code on server
- API for front-end to communicate

### Postman
- APIs not designed for people, so a bit horrible to use, but need to test
- Make sure to add `Accept` header
- Use `raw` and `JSON` for body
- Demonstrate [restful.training](https://restful.training)
