# Day 2: Afternoon

### Routing
- Routing turns an HTTP request into some running code
- Live in the `routes` directory
- Add a `GET` route

### Controller
- Explain what controllers are
- Use `artisan` to make a controller
- Show the `Articles` controller
- Add `use App\Article` at top

### Route Model Binding
- Currently get 500 error is try to update an invalid ID
- Want to turn 500 errors into 400 errors
- So common Laravel has it built in
- Use type hinting to ask for an `Article`
- Update all URL parameter routes
