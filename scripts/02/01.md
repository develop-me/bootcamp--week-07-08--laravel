# Day 2: Morning

## Structure of Day
- Homestead
- Databases

## Setup
- Mention `composer global require laravel/installer`

    DB_PASSWORD=secret
    ```

- MVC
- compare to other stack: e.g. WordPress, backend, frontend, database, templates, data structures, logic, WP has REST API, can use headless with /wp-json/
- Why not Node?

## Blade Basics
- introduction: how we make our views
    - PHP templating provided with Laravel
        - PHP and HTML files
        - mix of static and dynamic
    - `.blade.php` file extension
    - typically stored in the `resources/views` directory
- Homepage
- [`@extends`](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/blade#extending-a-layout)
- [`@section`](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/blade#defining-a-layout)
- [Partials/`@include`](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/blade#including-subviews)

## Eloquent
- Going to store animals, owners etc. in database
- Need to setup database
- Way to read/write to database
- Show `artisan`: **run on box**

## Database Migrations
- Database dumps

- Create `Article` model and migration
- Explain `up` and `down`
- Write article migration
- Run article migration: `artisan migrate`
- Check database
- Explain rollback: `artisan migrate rollback` discuss "steps": `artisan migrate rollback --step=1`

## Models
- Don't want to write MySQL in PHP: strings are unpleasant to work with and limits us to MySQL
- ORM: Ruby on Rails popularised, Eloquent
- Check out the Article model
- Creates Article model class, thus the uppercase "A"
- Explain why singular name used
- Use tinker to create a new model
- Look at `id` after save
- Explain Eloquent models a bit
- Make a change and look at `updated_at` property
- Show `Article::all()` and `Article::find()`
- Quick `Article::where()` demo: `Article::where('title', 'Blah')->orderBy('title')->get()`
- Comparisons `Article::where('updated_at', '>', '2020-03-01')->orderBy('created_at')->get()`

## Blade Dynamic Data
