#Â Adding all our form fields

1. You have databaser columns for:
    - `name`
    - `type`
    - `dob`
    - `biteyness`

    Unless you've set these to nullable (allows null/empty) then all of these need to be filled in to create a new Animal

1. Add inputs and labels for all the fields, making sure to update the `id`s and `name`s too
