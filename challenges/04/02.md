# Setting up to deal with form data

1. Create a new `createPost()` method on your Animals controller.

1. This method should use the `Request $request` type-hinting to make `$request` object available to it

1. Use the `all()` method on the `$request` object to get the submitted data from the form

1. Feed this data into the `create()` method of your Model

1. Finally redirect the user with `return redirect("/");`

1. Give it a test, you should get a "Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\MassAssignmentException" error
