# Setting up for Create Animal Form

1. create a new template called `form.blade.php` inside your `animals` folder

1. create a new `create()` method on your Animals controller to use that template (no need to pass in any data)

1. create a new route for `/animals/create` (this will need to be above any `/animals/{article}` route)

1. set that route to use the new `"Animals@create"` method
