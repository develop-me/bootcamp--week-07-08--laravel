# Repopulate your form fields when submission fails validation

1. You'll need to use `value="{{ old("title") }}"` to repopulate the field for an `<input>` field. `<textarea>` and `<select>` are a bit different.

## Advanced

1. Add client-side validation in the HTML where possible by adding `required` to input elements, etc.
