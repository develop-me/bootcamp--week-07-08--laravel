# Add Validation to your Form

1. create a form request with `artisan make:request AnimalRequest`

1. in the new file in `app/Http/Requests/AnimalRequest.php` set `auth` to `true`

1. set some validation rules. See the [Laravel docs here](https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#available-validation-rules) for the available validation rules, e.g.:

    ```php
    public function rules()
    {
        return [
            "title" => ["required", "string"],
            "article" => ["required", "string"],
        ];
    }
    ```

1. Set your controller to `use App\Http\Requests\AnimalRequest;`

1. Change the `Request` to `AnimalRequest` to use the validation rules

1. Test creating another animal using the form with some data missing or incorrect
