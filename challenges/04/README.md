# Challenges

Build a login system for your blog.

It should have:

- A registration form
    - Don't let a user re-register
- A login form
    - Don't show the login form if they're logged in
- A forgotten password form
    - Try not to give away if the user is registered
- Validation on all forms
    - Check for valid email address
    - Check password strength
- A login/logout button
- A user account page where the can update their email, name, and password

In a real Laravel app you would use the built-in authentication package, which we'll be looking at next week.
