# Feeding data into Blade templates

1. the `view()` function accepts two arguments:
    1. the Blade template to use for the view
    1. any data to be used in building that view

        "animals" => [
            ['name' => 'Bob'],
            ['name' => 'Mary'],
            ['name' => 'Sue'],
        ]
    ]
    ```
