# Feeding data into Blade templates

1. the `view()` function accepts two arguments:
    1. the Blade template to use for the view
    1. any data to be used in building that view
    
    Feed this array into your `view()` function for `/animals` route as the second argument:
    ```php
    [
        "animals" => [
            ['name' => 'Bob'],
            ['name' => 'Mary'],
            ['name' => 'Sue'],
        ]
    ]
    ```

1. create a folder called `animals` inside `resources/views` folder.

1. Set up a new `list.blade.php` template file in that folder that extends the master template.

1. test by visiting the `/animals` page

1. output your content in the template with `{{ dd($animals) }}`
