# Animals controller

1. Make your first controller for your animals with:
    ```bash
    artisan make:controller Animals
    ```
1. Add `use App\Animal;` to the top of your controller in `app/Http/Controllers/Animals.php`

1. Set up a new method `index`:
    ```php
    public function index()
    {
        return view("animals/list", [
            "animals" => Animal::all()
        ]);
    }
    ```

1. Set that route to use the new `index` method on your `Animals` controller with `"Animals@index"`

1. Change array `['name']` to object `->name` syntax in `list.blade.php` to output your animal Model properties.

1. Give it a test!
