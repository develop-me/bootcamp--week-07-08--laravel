# Creating your own Model method

1. add this inside your Animal model class
    ```php
    protected $dates = [
        'dob' // change to your field name for date of birth
    ];
    ```

1. create a new `relativeDate` method in your Animal model

1. set it to return `$this->dob->diffForHumans()` (change `dob` if your field was called something different)

1. `exit` tinker

1. go back into tinker, use `$animal = Animal::find({id})` to get an animal object from the Model

1. use your new method on it to show age
