# Setting up your owners model, and a one-to-many relationship

1. Create a new Owner model by using `artisan` command. You'll need a migration too so be sure to include the `-m` part.

    REMEMBER: both case and it being singular are important in your Model name.

1. Write your `create_owners_table` migration file, with fields for:
    - `name` - the owner's name
    - `address` - where they live

1. Run your migration.

1. Use `artisan tinker` to make your first owner. Test you can see it with `Owner::all();` or go to the database to `SELECT` to see it.

1. You'll then need another modify migration for your animals table to add in the foreign key for adding an `owner_id` to an animal, to complete the relationship between animals and owners:
    ```php
    // create the owner_id column
    $table->bigInteger("owner_id")->unsigned()->default(1);

    // set up the foreign key constraint
    $table->foreign("owner_id")->references("id")->on("animals")->onDelete("cascade");
    ```

1. Run the migration

1. Now add the Eloquent relationships so the Owner and Animal Models have the correct relationship.

    You'll need to:
    
        - add an `owner()` method to your Animal model with `belongsTo()` (refer to notes)

        - add `animals()` method to your Owner model with `hasMany()`

1. Now use `artisan tinker` to add a new owner, then a new animal that belongs to this owner (owner id 2?)

1. Test getting this animal with `Animal::find({new animal id})` and then $animal->owner; to see if the two are "linked"
