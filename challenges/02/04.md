# Overriding content

1. Use `@yield('title')` to replace the dynamic part of `index.blade.php` within `<title>` tags in the `<head>`

1. Use `@section` to populate data into the template's `@yield` directive in your new child layout (`about.blade.php`)

1. TEST the content is populated for the new `/about` route

1. Set fallback or default content in the `@yield` directive on `index.blade.php`

1. TEST the title is populated for the original index route
