# Migrations: adding columns (fields) later

1. We want to add a new fields to the existing `animals` table, so we need a new migration to do that
    
    `artisan make:migration modify_animals_table`

1. In the new migration file add new fields for:
    - `weight`: think about how we might store units
    - `height`: again, think about how we might store units

1. Run the migration with `artisan migrate`

1. use `mysql -u root -psecret` and ```USE `homestead`;``` ```SHOW TABLES;``` to prove its worked

1. Test the rollback with `artisan migrate:rollback` or `artisan migrate:rollback --step=1` and then `artisan migrate` again to re-run
