# Migrations: Altering existing columns later

1. To alter existing columns we need a new dependency in our project. Outside of your homestead box (so on your computer, but in your Laravel project root folder) run:
    `composer require doctrine/dbal`

1. Make a new migration to again modify the `animals` table

1. Use: `$table->string('name', 50)->change();`

1. Think about what the `down` method (rollback) would need for this migration. What is the reverse?
