# Migrations

1. Create an `Animal` model using the appropriate `artisan` command.

1. Write the migration to create a table with the following fields:
    - `name`: the name of the animal/patient
    - `type`: what type of animal it is
    - `dob`: when was the patient born
    - `biteyness`: a number between 1 and 5

    **Note: you should use snake_case, or this will cause you trouble later on!**

1. Run the migration with `artisan migrate`

1. use `mysql` and ```USE `homestead`;``` ```SHOW TABLES;``` to prove its worked

1. Test the rollback with `artisan migrate:rollback` and `artisan migrate` again to recreate.
