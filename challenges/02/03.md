# Extending existing templates & overriding content

1. Create a new "page" child view that extends `index.blade.php` with `@extends`
1. Create a new route for it at `/about`
1. TEST the new route URL from above loads
1. Use `@yield('title')` to replace the dynamic part of `index.blade.php
1. Use `@section` to populate data into the template's `@yield` directive in your new child layout
1. TEST the content is populated for the new `/about` route
1. Set fallback or default content in the `@yield` directive
1. TEST the title is populated for the original index route
