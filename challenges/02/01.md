# First Laravel Project

1. Getting a Homestead box up and running in a project called `vets`
    - `cd` to a place where you want to make your new project folder, e.g. `cd develop-me/week07`
    - `laravel new vets` - this will create a folder called `vets`
    - `cd vets`
    - `composer require laravel/homestead`
    - `vendor/bin/homestead make`
    - In `homestead.yaml` change `memory` to `512`
    - If you want a domain other than `homestead.test` then set this in `sites > map`
    - edit `.env` file and change the database settings to:
        ```yaml
        DB_DATABASE=homestead
        DB_USERNAME=root
        DB_PASSWORD=secret
        ```
    - `vagrant up` to provision (setup) this new Homestead machine
1. Verify your Homestead is working by visiting [homestead.test](http://homestead.test) or whatever domain you set above [192.168.10.10](http://192.168.10.10) on Windows
