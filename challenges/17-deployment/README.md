## Deployment

**Follow the instructions to the letter, otherwise it's not going to work. Ask for help if you get stuck!**

- Create a new EC2 instance with AWS
- **Once you've created the instance send the instructor a message containing your IPv4 Public IP (e.g. `35.177.84.188`) and your desired subdomain (e.g. `something.developme.space`)**
- Get your SSH key setup
- Now, run through the server setup process
- Deploy your Laravel project
- Use `certbot` to add HTTPS support to your site
- Set yourself a reminder to terminate your instance in about 8 weeks' time
