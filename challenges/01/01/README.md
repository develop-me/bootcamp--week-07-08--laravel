### Optional: Other APIs

- Play around with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/documentation)

- See if you can do anything with the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search). You'll need a Twitter account and an API key (https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens). This isn't easy!
