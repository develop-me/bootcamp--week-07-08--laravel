# Accessing the MySQL Prompt

1. Run `vagrant ssh` to access your virtual machine's terminal

1. Run `mysql -u root -p` and use password `root` to access the MySQL prompt.

1. View which databases already exist with `SHOW DATABASES;`

1. Create a new database.

1. `USE` that database, so for future queries you don't need to specify which database you're working with.
