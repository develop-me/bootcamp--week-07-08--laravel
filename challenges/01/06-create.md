# Planning and creating tables

1. Plan out a relational database for our vets practice (on paper?).

    You'll want to be able to store information on *animals* and *owners*, this should be done with two tables.

    Think about what data the vets might want to store, the field names and suitable data types.

1. Show it to the instructor or Teaching Assistant.

1. Write your `CREATE TABLE` queries (best done in a code editor) and run them on the MySQL prompt.

## Advanced

1. add another table into your vets database system, it could be for *procedures* (name, date, cost, pet id) or  *invoices* (owner id, total, invoice date, payment date)

1. set up a PHP script to access the data. Useful sample code [is here](php-and-databases.php).
