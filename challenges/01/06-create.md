# Planning and creating tables

1. Plan out a relational database for our vets practice. You'll want to be able to store information on *animals* and *owners*, this should be done with two tables. Think about what data the vets might want to store.

1. Show it to the instructor or Teaching Assistant.

1. Write your `CREATE TABLE` queries (best done in a code editor) and run them on the MySQL prompt.

1. Populate your tables with data using `INSERT` queries.

## Advanced

1. setup a PHP script to access the data. Useful sample code [is here](php-and-databases.php).
